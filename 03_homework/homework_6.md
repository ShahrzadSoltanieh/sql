**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on my previous roles as a cost analyst and now as a project data analyst in a construction company, it is clear that integrating ethics and equity into my work is crucial. My experience with data has primarily involved analyzing costs, budgets, and project timelines. While these tasks may seem purely quantitative, they are deeply interconnected with ethical considerations and the potential for inequity.

In my previous role as a cost analyst, I focused on analyzing financial data to optimize project budgets and expenditures. One key ethical consideration here is transparency. Ensuring that cost data is transparent to all stakeholders, including contractors, suppliers, and clients, helps in building trust and preventing potential disputes.

Additionally, it is important to ensure that resources were allocated fairly among all subcontractors, including smaller ones. This means making sure that the data we use to make decisions does not unfairly favor larger subcontractors over smaller ones. For example, if the data we present or interpret during the bidding process is biased, it might make it harder for smaller subcontractors to win contracts, even if they are equally or more capable. To prevent this, we need to regularly review our processes and data to identify and correct any biases, ensuring a fair chance for all subcontractors.

In my current role as a project data analyst, I analyze comprehensive data, including project timelines, workforce data, and resource usage. Handling personal data of clients, employees, and contractors requires strict adherence to data privacy and security regulations.

By embedding ethical considerations and promoting equity in all aspects of data analysis, we can create a more inclusive and fair working environment.
